 This software app is written in Processing but can easily be ported to other languages, any language that supports serial
 ports can be used to interface with NLED controllers. All NLED controllers are seen as serial ports but are commonly USB
 devices. This software can interface with both native USB devices and USB to serial adapters.
 
 This software app is simple, it allows the user to input the command ID# and the data bytes then parse the command to the device.
 
Instructions:
 1. Start software
 2. Select your device's COM port from the drop down.
 3. Click Open Port button to open the selected port, if it turns green it sucessfully connected to the port.
 4. Use either slot#1 or slot#2 to fill in what command you want to parse. See the command sheet PDF for details on commands.
	Note: Slot#1 and slot#2 are only used for the user to fill in commands, and are not otherwise anything specific. Either one does the same thing.
	
Live Control Instructions: For example device with 30 channels
 1. Run as above but at instruction #4 go to next step
 2. Set command to #60, bulk live control, set data#1 to 1 for enable, set data#2 to 0 for 8-bit, set data#3 to 0 for MSB, set data#4 to 30 for channel LSB
 3. Run or click button to run FillLiveControlPacket() with whatever data the user wants.
 4. Run or click SendLiveControlPacket() to send the data to the controller.
 5. Keep updating the LiveControlArray array with updated user data, then run SendLiveControlPacket() to send the new data to the controller
 6. When finished sending data the controller can be powered off or, send 60 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0, to disable live control mode
